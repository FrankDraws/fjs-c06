This repo was branch c06 from my main site. 

## Description
While working on my main site, the use of some of my branches changed from containing features or updates, to being full fledged alternative versions. 

After searching for "using branches as storage" I learned it's "good practice" not to use branches as storage and either export said branches as an archive (i.e. zip) or their own individual repos. I chose the latter.

I learned how to export a branch from one repo, [into its own repo here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2227571/792868).

## Contributing
This site is for my personal use. Although, if anyone feels like creating their own version, fork away.
