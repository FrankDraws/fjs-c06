Welcome to my website. It's currently under construction as of Tue 6/1/21.

You can view the live site at [FrankJuval.com](https://www.frankjuval.com).

## Usage
This site is to simply showcase some of the work I've done over the past several years. Currently, all the work displayed is from my time at Universal. Eventually I will add other projects.

## Contributing
This site is for my personal use. Although, if anyone feels like creating their own version, feel free to do so.
