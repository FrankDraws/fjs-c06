                <span>I was instrumental in the font change from Gotham to Avenir Next. I helped solved technical font issues in order for the team to test and deploy. I audited the site, put together documentation and tests showing how the font change would affect pages.</span>

                <span>I worked closely with the dev team and helped solve problems with CSS, improve animation timing, improve upon ideas.</span> I also collaborated with teams outside of ours, including the Innovation team where I tested, consulted,
                and help make decisions for future tech and applications.
