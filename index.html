                    I'm an artist that found success in design, branding, frontend development, web animation, UX, and UI. In my twenty-five plus years of experience I helped build and/or improve experiences for Universal Parks and Resorts, Marriott Vacation Club, and Tupperware.

                    I don't just build digital experiences with my hands, I've also lead initiatives and influenced senior leadership into launching successfull applications across Universal Parks & Resorts and NBC. I also partnered with the innovation team to bring the
                    chatbot to Universal.

                    My original major was traditional animation. I had my foot in the door at Disney but then life happened. So I switched gears into print and web design and it paid off. I've worked with major brands such as Tupperware, Home Depot, Boeing, Target, Disney,
