          Entrepreneurial, creative professional full of moxie, with a penchant
          for knowledge, higher thinking, and systems with twenty-six years of
          experience in design, brand development, web development, and
          animation. I’ve developed web presence solutions for major
          corporations including Marriott, Universal, and NBC. Now I'm putting
          those years of experience and expertise to work for small businesses.

          Page is stepping down as CEO of Alphabet, while Brin is resigning as
          its president. They will remain board members of Alphabet, a company
          that oversees not just Google but also research into artificial
          intelligence and self-driving cars.
        </p>
        <p>
          Page and Brin founded Google in 1998 when they were Stanford students.
          They made Google into one of the world's largest, most profitable
          companies, dominating online search, digital advertising and video.

          "We've never been ones to hold on to management roles when we think
          there's a better way to run the company," they wrote in a letter
          Tuesday. "And Alphabet and Google no longer need two CEOs and a
          President."
        </p>

          In an email to Google employees, Pichai said that in his more than 15
          years with Google, "the only constant I've seen is change. This
          process of continuous evolution — which the founders often refer to as
          'uncomfortably exciting' — is part of who we are."
        </p>

          The restructuring at the top of Google comes as at time of increased
          turmoil for the Internet giant.

          Google, the company that was known for the motto "don't be evil," has
          been known for its open and freewheeling culture, with employees
          encouraged to speak out. But lately, management has been cracking down
          on dissent and criticism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google fired four engineers last week for accessing internal
          information. But the workers said they lost their jobs over their
          labor-organizing efforts. They said they will file a complaint with
          the National Labor Relations Board.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last year, thousands of Google workers around the world walked out in
          protest of sexual harassment and bad behavior by executives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google, along with Facebook and Amazon, is under scrutiny into whether
          it's too powerful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regulators in the U.S. and Europe are looking into how dominant Google
          is in search and advertising. Some critics are even calling for the
          company to be broken up. There's no indication that any of this is
          connected to Page and Brin stepping aside. It's just another sign of
          how the company is changing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Page and Brin acknowledged that Google is no longer the same company
          they founded. "Since we wrote our first founders' letter, the company
          has evolved and matured," they wrote Tuesday.
